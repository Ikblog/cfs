            <h1>What is Forex? A Beginner’s Guide to the World’s Largest Financial Market</h1>
        </header>

        <section class="content">
            <p>Forex, short for “foreign exchange,” refers to the global marketplace where currencies are traded. It’s one of the most dynamic, liquid, and decentralized financial markets in the world, with an estimated daily trading volume exceeding $6 trillion. Unlike other markets, forex doesn’t have a central exchange; instead, it operates 24 hours a day across major financial hubs, including New York, London, Tokyo, and Sydney.</p>
            
            <h2>Why Forex Exists</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>International Trade:</strong> Businesses need to exchange currencies to trade goods and services across borders.</li>
                <li><strong>Tourism:</strong> Travelers exchange their home currency for the local currency when visiting other countries.</li>
                <li><strong>Investment and Speculation:</strong> Forex is also a marketplace for investors and speculators looking to profit from the fluctuations in currency values.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Key Players in Forex</h2>
            <p>Forex participants are diverse, ranging from individual traders to major financial institutions. Here are the main actors:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Central Banks:</strong> They influence the forex market by managing their country’s currency reserves.</li>
                <li><strong>Commercial Banks:</strong> Banks trade currencies on behalf of their clients and conduct large-scale transactions.</li>
                <li><strong>Corporations:</strong> Companies engaged in international trade use forex to exchange currencies.</li>
                <li><strong>Retail Traders:</strong> Individuals who trade currencies for speculation and investment purposes.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How Forex Works</h2>
            <p>The forex market revolves around trading currency pairs, where one currency is exchanged for another. Each currency pair consists of a <strong>base currency</strong> and a <strong>quote currency</strong>. For example, in the EUR/USD pair, EUR is the base currency, and USD is the quote currency.</p>

            <h2>Types of Forex Markets</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Spot Market:</strong> The spot market is the primary forex market where currency pairs are traded for immediate delivery.</li>
                <li><strong>Forward Market:</strong> Contracts are made to buy or sell currencies at a future date.</li>
                <li><strong>Futures Market:</strong> Standardized contracts traded on exchanges with greater regulation.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Forex Trading Strategies</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Technical Analysis:</strong> Studying price charts to predict future market movements.</li>
                <li><strong>Fundamental Analysis:</strong> Focusing on economic factors like interest rates and inflation.</li>
                <li><strong>Sentiment Analysis:</strong> Gauging the mood of the market.</li>
            </ul>

            <h1>What Is Traded in Forex?</h1>
        </header>

        <section class="content">
            <p>In the forex (foreign exchange) market, <strong>currencies</strong> are the primary assets traded. Forex involves the exchange of one currency for another with the goal of profiting from fluctuations in currency values. Here’s what is actually traded in forex:</p>
            
            <h2>1. Currency Pairs</h2>
            <p>Forex is based on <strong>currency pairs</strong>, where one currency is quoted against another. Each pair consists of a <strong>base currency</strong> and a <strong>quote currency</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Base Currency:</strong> The first currency in the pair (e.g., EUR in EUR/USD).</li>
                <li><strong>Quote Currency:</strong> The second currency in the pair (e.g., USD in EUR/USD).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The price of the currency pair represents how much of the quote currency is required to buy one unit of the base currency.</p>

            <h2>2. Major Currency Pairs</h2>
            <p>The most traded currency pairs are referred to as <strong>major pairs</strong>, which typically include the U.S. dollar (USD) on one side. Examples include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>EUR/USD</strong> (Euro / US Dollar)</li>
                <li><strong>GBP/USD</strong> (British Pound / US Dollar)</li>
                <li><strong>USD/JPY</strong> (US Dollar / Japanese Yen)</li>
                <li><strong>USD/CHF</strong> (US Dollar / Swiss Franc)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Minor Currency Pairs</h2>
            <p><strong>Minor currency pairs</strong> don’t involve the U.S. dollar but are still actively traded. Examples include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>EUR/GBP</strong> (Euro / British Pound)</li>
                <li><strong>AUD/JPY</strong> (Australian Dollar / Japanese Yen)</li>
                <li><strong>EUR/AUD</strong> (Euro / Australian Dollar)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. Exotic Currency Pairs</h2>
            <p><strong>Exotic pairs</strong> involve one major currency and one from a smaller, emerging market. Examples include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>USD/TRY</strong> (US Dollar / Turkish Lira)</li>
                <li><strong>USD/ZAR</strong> (US Dollar / South African Rand)</li>
                <li><strong>EUR/TRY</strong> (Euro / Turkish Lira)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>5. Commodities as Influencing Factors</h2>
            <p>While currencies are the primary asset in forex trading, certain commodities like oil, gold, and silver influence currency movements. For example, Canada’s currency often fluctuates with oil prices, impacting pairs like <strong>USD/CAD</strong>.</p>

            <h2>6. Other Instruments in Forex Markets</h2>
            <p>In addition to spot trading of currency pairs, the forex market also offers instruments like:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Forwards and Futures:</strong> Contracts to buy or sell a currency at a future date.</li>
                <li><strong>Options:</strong> The right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a currency at a set price.</li>
                <li><strong>CFDs (Contracts for Difference):</strong> A speculative tool that allows traders to bet on price movements without owning the currency.</li>
            </ul>
